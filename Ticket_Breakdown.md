# Ticket Breakdown
We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**


Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".


You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

## Your Breakdown Here

1. Create new table, to store the facility_agent mapping along with
the `id` which can act as primary key, which can be displayed
on the reports.
    Table name: `facility_agent_mapping`
    Schema:
        id: uuid | string
        facility_id: (ref to id of facility table)
        agent_id: (ref to id of agent table)
        created_on: timestamp |
        updated_on: timestamp | (audit columns)

2. getShiftsByFacility(string facility_id): will also contain the metadata from the facility_agent_mapping. We can do a batch get or index based query(in case of rdbms), based on the combination of `(facility_id, agent_id)`, to get the metadata from the new table.


3. generateReport(list shifts):
    now will have the custom_id generated by the facilities and passed on by getShiftsByFacility as metadata of arguement.
    It can generate the PDF, keeping this new custom_id `id` 
    as the id of agent while generating the PDF 


Time Estimates:
    Task_1: 3h-4h to create new table and dump with some test data
    Task 2: 1Day, based on complexity of existing code, along with unit tests and testing the code changes
    Task 3: 1Day, dev + unit test + testing code changes

    Task 2 and 3 can be done in parallel by different team members, based on the common agreed contract.

    1Day for getting the PR raised by individual dev's reviewed & merged to a common feature branch and get the QA/(integration test) approval for this
    feature branch on staging/QA env.

    1Day for testing in preprod env, after the PR gets merged to master,
    and staggered released(percentage wise) in prod, deployment and monitoring the logs/health_checks/metrics of the service.

    Overall this feature can be completed in around 4 work days. Keeping some buffer for unforseen circumstances(prod bugs/issues),
    and conservative estimates for this feature task, that can communicated from engg side is 5 working days, with 2 backend 
    devs bandwidth, 1 QA bandwidth, and 1devops engineer for a day bandwidth
    to provision resources for the new required table(in all the 
    environments).
